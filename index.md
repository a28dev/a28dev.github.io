Did you know that the United States prison system in 2023 utilizes forced labor for both commercial and governmental corporations?

This is possible due to a loophole in the 13th amendment of the US constitution:

> ***Section 1**. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, **except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted**, shall exist within the United     States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.*
> 
>  ***Section 2**. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.*

Join a growing campaign to end this loophole once and for all 

You can play your part and help in a number of ways
