# The birthright of a slaveholding nation is generational trauma

Did you know that the United States prison system in 2023 utilizes forced labor for both commercial and governmental corporations?[^1]

In fact every year prisoners produce $2 billion worth in goods and $9 billion worth in services[^2]. While they are compensated at rates far below the federal minimum wage, or in some cases for nothing at all[^3].

This is possible due to a loophole in the 13th amendment of the US constitution:

> ***Section 1**. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, **except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted**, shall exist within the United     States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.*
> 
>  ***Section 2**. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.*

We cannot sit back and let corporations continue to profit off of this injustice.
